**An AI Journal of some sorts**
I made this because I'm constantly procrastinating writing into my Internship Log book. That's because we learn a lot everyday and I just saw writing everything as daunting, so I used the llama3-8b-8192 model to summarize what I learned during the day, making it easier to write in the book. It's more of a me thing, but obviously it could be used in other things.
